Forcing VSync functionality to be controlled by the hardware at the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) level.

In graphic tech terms, VSync is designed to eliminate screen tearing, which can occur when your graphics card's frame rate is out of sync with your monitor's refresh rate. enable the GPU to handle VSync, which might result in smoother visual output, especially in graphically intensive applications like games.

System will not enforce any limit on the number of simultaneous processes. This could potentially allow more applications to run at the same time, which might improve multi-tasking

The device can operate without imposing any temperature restrictions that may occur.
